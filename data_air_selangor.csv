12/10/2020 12:16,Congrat. U achiveve your KPI to have at least one water cut per month.
12/10/2020 14:37,Achievement for water cut every month during cmco???
12/10/2020 12:35,Judge panel for the award probably not staying in/from Selangor
12/10/2020 12:17,"Hmm how is it being judged? More water pollution, more cleaning so you all did good job in cleaning and safe treat water ???? I think not best time to boost about your award cos we all damn angry, how come no control and punitive punishment?? I don't see other states having so much of this problems"
12/10/2020 12:18,"  Air Selangor Have you no shame at all? Your skin so thick? Are you so disconnected from the real world, that in your own world and echo chamber, you keep saying, keep thinking you're the best? "
12/10/2020 13:21,"Please work closely with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources or whichever ministry in charge of taking care of rivers and water sources to ensure rivers are protected and made clear instead of murky colours like Nescafé tarik or teh tarik. Better, build filtration systems at water intake point so that the treatment plants are less exposed to contaminants from the river."
12/10/2020 12:07,This is etf. Is that only one party join the contest? My grandma water'well provide better and consistent water than yours
12/10/2020 12:38,Joke. Every month without fail having water problem. There is where u stand out among other states water provider
12/10/2020 12:07,People make laugh of your so called 'achievement'. Remember that the power of Selangor citizens will determine your success. I don't know how much Air Selangor pay for this 'success' to the organiser Global Water Intelligence (GWI)
12/10/2020 12:08,Award of “times” water disruption among the month for the whole year.. 🎉 may be not just global award 👍🏿 keep it up. No one can compete with you
12/11/2020 15:35,"Wrong spelling there... Global water 'cut' award 😅  But still a good job though, Air Selangor cut water to ensure we do not consume polluted water, keeping us using clean and safe water, keep it on 👍"
12/10/2020 12:00,Selagi ada kilang haram tepi sungai selagi itu lah nama Air Selangor tidak akan bersih
12/10/2020 13:25,One of the criteria should be supply disruptions index
12/10/2020 12:02,"Based on ur performances this year..i dun think u deserves this award..""excellent achievement in delivering safe and clean water to ur consumer""...r u kidding me??"
12/10/2020 13:44,"HAHAHAHA,THIS IS AWARD FOR SHOPPE DAY THAT ONLY LEFT 2DAYS FROM NOW ON 12.12.2020.,SHOPPE AWARDS OKLAH BUT FOR THIS GLOBAL CERTIFICATE I REALLY2 CURIOUS/CANNOT IMAGINE,. ONE YEAR HOW MANY TIME WANTED TO STOP THAT LOJI2 WATER AROUND THIS RICHEST STATE"
12/10/2020 13:39,"Eh who is so ignorant to give you such award ? Or you manipulated data to look like you were best water management company? In any organisation, Quality and Deliverance is important.  In your case, well just look at your track record."
12/10/2020 12:30,Some awards can be bought.  Is this a legitimate award?  
12/10/2020 12:13,"Highly recommended for Water Disruption. U know, no need to say out this kind of things to other people."
12/13/2020 17:15,"Is this award based on........money amounted to get the award, or 100% based on your service? Just curious"
12/10/2020 12:11,I'm struggling to keep myself from bursting out laughing like a mad man. I'm sure you Air Selangor idiots timed this post so that it's after the recent water crisis was done with. Monthly water crises and you won this? Is the judging process for this award is as idiotic as your water crises prevention plan (or lack thereof)?🤣😂🤣
12/14/2020 4:00,"congratulations to national Water company of arab saudi being the winner, lol."
12/11/2020 13:44,“Highly commended” only ya hahaha don’t think they won!

12/10/2020 12:11,Air Selangor does that means consumer wgo failed to pay the water bill also be rewarded with waiver as well? We will continues to support air selangor no matter u have water cut 10 times a month in the year of 2021. 
12/11/2020 23:28,"Delivering clean and safe water, when there is.   ...give them some credit la."
12/13/2020 23:23,Highly commended ya. Not winner. There’s a difference.
12/10/2020 12:04,Habis aku ni XD anugerah ke..tiap bulan keja aku angkat tong dari blik stor . Air elok masuk balik..air Kojol keluo balikkk.. begitu la seterusnya.

12/12/2020 8:32,Terima kasih atas usaha tekun syabas untuk mengembalikan air bersih dari air yang tercemar. Terima kasih Kerana mengembalikan nostalgia beratur dengan baldi untuk mendapatkan air. Terima kasih kerana mengesyorkan penjimatan air  di kalangan masyarakat umum.
12/11/2020 17:48,How much to pay for this?
12/10/2020 12:52,"Tiap bulan tak de air pun boleh dapat anugrah,.. luar biasa😁 "
12/10/2020 13:33,"keep it up the good work. kalau tak disebabkan tindakan cpt mereka, ramai yang keracunan air.. pihak lain punya salah, pihak yang lain yang dipersalahkan... 😤😤"
12/10/2020 12:36,"Is this a joke? Even drinking water in shops and supermarkets were cleaned out. I was parched from no water even for drinking.. Had to drink 100 plus.. Next time, have to bathe with 100plus too."
12/10/2020 14:32,Why i cant stop laughing looking at this post 🤣🤣🤣

12/10/2020 12:38,Ini anugarah setiap  bulan berhenti Air ke patutlah menang Tampa bertanding...🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/11/2020 21:37,"Tak ada gunanya kalau kerap tak ada air. It is utterly worthless, it could even be unbenificial, as the top management of Air Selangor would continue to be in cloud nine with big fat bonuses and increments whilst millions of users continue to suffer the anxeity of frequently interrupted water supply. No reasons accepted.... dah berapa tahun ""merdeka""? Dah berapa tahun Selanor ""negeri maju""? Dah berapa tahun berangan? Dah berapa tahun dosa terkumpul...?"
12/10/2020 12:03,It should be most water cuts in a year award?😓
12/10/2020 14:08,"Apa bagusnya award ni utk rakyat selangor? Tlg ye, provide schedule utk next gangguan bekalan"
12/13/2020 21:45,Award untuk kekerapan Tak de air bila nak ishtihar?  Pengarah syabas ni sedar ke idak shah alam kerap x de air?   Ade beza ke dapat award dgn ketiadaan air kat shah alam ni?
,

12/11/2020 19:05,Shortlist ni dinilai darisegi kekerapan komunikasi n respon dengan pengguna serta kemesraan dan kesabaran memberi jawapan yang sopan dan selamat ketika melayan maki hamun dari pengguna... Tapi dipusing kononnya kecemerlangan membekalkan air yang bersih dan selamat...
12/10/2020 12:48,The best among the bad ones i guess....anyway do u hv the 2021 water cut takwim? 
12/10/2020 11:59,Penutup 2020 banyak benda yang hiburkan hati 🤣

12/15/2020 14:30,"What a super joke of the century.  1) Pipeline build by Developer n collect money by them. No need to ""invest"" (F*** x1)   2) User paid for the cost of water pipe supply yet paid for the money to buy water.  (F*** x2)   3) Air Selangor sit there n get awarded not only by collecting money but happyly just said water supply polluted n water need to cut supply n consumers can't do anything. (F*** x 3)  4) No regular checking n maintenance, plant so frequent breakdown, yet consumers can't do anything. (F*** x 4)  5) most of the hse owner hv to install filter due to pooor water quality. (F*** x 5)  Dont u think u should feel shame to get this award. (unfortunately the guys given the award was not stay in Malaysia, I think so, if not he should think twice to give out this award) This is just my personal view, if not agreed, pls ignored n I apologise for the comments."

12/12/2020 10:04,"This agency is real, the award of that category (Public Water Agency of the year) is also real.  Under this category, the website only mentioned award for ""winner"" and ""distinction"". Both are not Air Selangor.  Getting award for ""highly recommend"" is not mentioned anywhere in the website.  My personal guess, best scenario, this ""highly recommended award"" are given to those successfully short listed in the award or worst case just a participation certificate.  https://globalwaterawards.com/2020-public-water-agency-of-the-year/"
12/29/2020 13:26,"Kudos. As far as problem solving and troubleshooting you have tried to do your best.  To be fair, it should be emphasized that ministerial departments responsible for the environment and punishing offender companies should also do their part to eradicate existing polluters which is the current serious root of the contamination problems.  Other than pollution issues, going forward you only need to work on planning to anticipate and preventive/ maintenance measures to avoid unnecessary stress and headaches for you and your consumers."
