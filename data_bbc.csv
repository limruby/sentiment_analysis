"What people forget is that there are actually agents of the cpc/communist party whose role is to follow Asian celebrities and troll/express anger at any ""anti-chinese""/anti-party content.

How would Chinese fans even watch the video unless they are using a VPN? Which would leave them vulnerable to being arrested. And not to mention using a vpn is an act of rebellion against the CCP regime anyway.

Luca Gentile Nah. In India where they are majority hindu they enact laws that are disciminatory to muslims. Thats what is happening kashmir.  Im afraid your theory of alternating powers is just a specific case on certain groups of people.  It wont happen if certain groups who form the large majority are entrenched in their beliefs. Another assumption you make is that these bipartisan groups don't overlap in beliefs. They may have a large overlapping majority that agree on certain issues to the detriment of the minority.

Tell the towns, your God is coming!”   (Ezekiel 21:8)- “give the people this message from the Lord.”   (Joel 2:2)- “blow the trumpet, sound an alarm.”   (Joel 2:1)- “the day of the Lord is upon us. Let everyone tremble in fear.”   (Habakkuk 2:3)- “If it seems slow in coming, wait patently, for it will surely take place. It will not be delayed.”   (Ezekiel 21:6)- “when it comes true, the boldest heart will melt with fear; all strength will disappear. Every spirit will faint, and Strong knees will become as weak as water.”  (Ezekiel 21:30)- “ I will judge each of you. According to your actions, says the sovereign Lord.”  (Ezekiel 20:45)- “And I will set you on fire”   (Joel 2:12)- That is why the Lord says, “turn to me now while there is time.” Return to The Lord your God, for he is merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.”   Version 8.9X2b",1/14/2021 10:46

"What people forget is that there are actually agents of the cpc/communist party whose role is to follow Asian celebrities and troll/express anger at any ""anti-chinese""/anti-party content.

(yes there are a portion of Chinese fans that may be die hard supporters of the Party and actually get mad at political speak, I've met them, but there are a lot of state sponsored troll agents online).",1/14/2021 10:45
He's pandering to China and I've no interest in following him again. ,1/14/2021 10:44
How would Chinese fans even watch the video unless they are using a VPN? Which would leave them vulnerable to being arrested. And not to mention using a vpn is an act of rebellion against the CCP regime anyway.

"What people forget is that there are actually agents of the cpc/communist party whose role is to follow Asian celebrities and troll/express anger at any ""anti-chinese""/anti-party content.

How would Chinese fans even watch the video unless they are using a VPN? Which would leave them vulnerable to being arrested. And not to mention using a vpn is an act of rebellion against the CCP regime anyway.

"What people forget is that there are actually agents of the cpc/communist party whose role is to follow Asian celebrities and troll/express anger at any ""anti-chinese""/anti-party content. They make it seem that the ""Chinese fans"" are mad.  (yes there are a portion of Chinese fans that may be die hard supporters of the Party and actually get mad at political speak, I've met them, but there are a lot of state sponsored troll agents online).",1/14/2021 10:45
He's pandering to China and I've no interest in following him again. ,1/14/2021 10:44
How would Chinese fans even watch the video unless they are using a VPN? Which would leave them vulnerable to being arrested. And not to mention using a vpn is an act of rebellion against the CCP regime anyway. If he means Chinese fans in Hong Kong and Taiwan then they are hardly going to be angry about criticising the extreme brutality of the Chinese government ,1/14/2021 17:05
